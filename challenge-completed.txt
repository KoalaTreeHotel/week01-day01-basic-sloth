Requested basic HTML elements included in page.

Initially had day01 and day02 challenges merged together on the same page.
Have now separated them into 2 distinct pages.

Keeping git history intact by:
(1) cloning combined page to a bare repo on local machine
(2) pushing this bare repo to a working repo on github
(3) cloning the working repo from github to local machine and stripping out day02 code
